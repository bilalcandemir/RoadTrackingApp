Tech Stack:
- Swift
- UIKit
- MapKit
- Core Location
- Used xib for the designes

About architecture:
- We are using MVVM for the architecture. But not the classic version. We split the navigation processes to Router.swift class. So we are not trying to write whole navigation (pop, push, present etc.) inside the view controllers.
